            Now! Let's kick some ice. Doesn't anyone stay dead anymore? I'm back. Gimme the goddam page! You did not make a victor.

            You're a funny guy sully... One of us is in deep trouble. Look who's talking. Cool off. It's just a scratch. Kill me! Only pain. C-coo-ool. I do not want to touch his ass.

            No i don't stop it. Excuse me. Come on bennet, let's party. And if you do not listen, then to hell with you. Let's kick some ice. The pavement with his enemy.

            I lied! Only pain. Put the cookie down. You are not you you're me. You're fired... Give you a lift? I'm a cop you idiot! Como esta. But i'm all woman. Go on! Shuuuuuttttuuuuup! My name is not quade.
